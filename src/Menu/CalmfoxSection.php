/**
 * The "Calmfox services" group in the admin sidebar, which every Calmfox plugin adds its pages to.
 *
 * The split it stands for: what belongs to one shipping or payment method stays on that method's
 * page, where Sylius keeps it and where a shopkeeper looks for it. What is set up once for the
 * whole service (an account, its keys, a connection, a policy) gets a page of its own here, so it
 * can be found without knowing which method happens to carry it, and changed without opening one.
 *
 * Every plugin carries its own copy of this class instead of depending on a shared package. The
 * group is found by its key, so whichever plugin builds the menu first creates it and the others
 * add to it; that only works while the key, label and icon are the same in every copy.
